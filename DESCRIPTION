Description: Zillow, an online real estate company, provides real estate
    and mortgage data for the United States through a REST API. The
    ZillowR package provides an R function for each API service, making it
    easy to make API calls and process the response into convenient,
    R-friendly data structures.  See
    <https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm> for the Zillow API
    Documentation. NOTE: Zillow deprecated their API on 2021-09-30, and
    this package is now deprecated as a result.
